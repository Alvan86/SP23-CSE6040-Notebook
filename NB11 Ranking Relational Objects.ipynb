    "You would expect \"importance\" to be related to whether an airport has lots of inbound or outgoing connections. In graph lingo, the number of such connections is called the _degree_ of a vertex or node. The _indegree_ is the number of incoming edges to a node, and the _outdegree_ is the number of outgoing edges.\n",

Therefore, in this notebook, let's try to use a PageRank-like scheme to rank airports and compare that to looking at degree."
